## About this project

AdverbVec is a Python tool for clustering and analyzing adverbs using high-dimensional embeddings. Leveraging advanced techniques, it provides a seamless way to explore the semantic relationships between adverbs in the Japanese language. With its intuitive interface and powerful features, AdverbVec empowers users to gain insights into adverb usage patterns and linguistic nuances.
    
## Getting Started

## Prerequisite

Install [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) on your computer.

Enter this into your computer's command line interface (terminal, control panel, etc.) to check the version:

  ```sh
  python --version
  ```

If the first number is not a 3, update to Python3.

## Setup

Here is an easy way to use our GitHub repository.

### Step 1: Clone the repository


Open the command line interface and run:
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/ericodle/AdverbVec.git
  ```

### Step 2: Navigate to the project directory
Find where your computer saved the project, then enter:

  ```sh
  cd /path/to/project/directory
  ```

If performed correctly, your command line interface should resemble

```
user@user:~/AdverbVec-main$
```

### Step 3: Create a virtual environment: 
I like to use a **virtual environment**.
Let's make one called "av-env"


```sh
python3 -m venv av-env
```

A virtual environment named "av-env" has been created. 
Let's enter the environment to do our work:


```sh
source av-env/bin/activate
```

When performed correctly, your command line interface prompt should look like 

```
(av-env) user@user:~/AdverbVec-main$
```

### Step 3: Install requirements.txt

Next, let's install specific software versions so everything works properly.

  ```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### Step 4: Run GenreDiscern

This project has a GUI for easy use.
Activate the GUI by running the following terminal command:

  ```sh
python3 xxx.py
  ```

#### function 1

Simply click

### function 2

Simply click

#### function 3

(Feature coming soon)
